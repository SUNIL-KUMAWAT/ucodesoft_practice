                </span><b>Cricket </b> is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field
                at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two
                bails balanced on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler,
                "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over"
                being completed once they have legally done so six times The batting side has one player at each end of
                the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball
                with a bat. The batting side scores runs when either the bowler unfairly bowls the ball to the batter,
                the ball reaches the boundary of the field, or the two batters swap ends of the pitch, which results in
                one run. The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss each batter (so they are "out",
                and are said to have "lost their wicket"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the bowled ball
                hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching a hit ball before it
                touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front
                of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams
                swap roles. At the end of the game, the team that scored more runs wins, provided that the other team
                has completed its one or two scheduled innings. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third
                umpire and match referee in international matches.

                <b> Indian Premier League (IPL)</b>, also officially known as TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons, is a
                professional men's Twenty20 cricket league, contested by ten teams based out of seven Indian cities and
                three Indian states.[1][2] The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in
                2007. It is usually held between March and May of every year and has an exclusive window in the ICC
                Future Tours Programme.[3]

                The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 was ranked sixth by average
                attendance among all sports leagues.[4] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to
                be broadcast live on YouTube.[5][6] The brand value of the <b><em> IPL in 2019 was ₹47,500 crore (US$5.9
                        billion) </em></b>, according to Duff & Phelps.[7] According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season
                contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy.[8] The 2020 IPL season set a
                massive viewership record with 31.57 million average impressions and with an overall consumption
                increase of 23 per cent from the 2019 season.
